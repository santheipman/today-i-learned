# Utilize `unsafe.Pointer` to Debug the Value of an Unexported Field

Today, I encountered a situation where I needed to log the value of an unexported field of a struct defined in a 3rd party package. `unsafe.Pointer` saved the day for me. The code I wrote looks something like this:

```golang
// type AnObject is defined a 3rd party package:
// type AnObject struct {
//  fieldA typeX
//  FieldB typeY 
// }

var anObject AnObject

// ...

v := reflect.ValueOf(anObject).Elem()
field := v.FieldByName("fieldA")

privateFieldPtr := unsafe.Pointer(field.UnsafeAddr())
privateFieldValue := *(*typeX)(privateFieldPtr)

fmt.Println("fieldA:", privateFieldValue)
```

Reading an unexported field of a struct is not recommened though, but this hack might save us in some specific situations.
