# Structure your application's packages for modularity

My mentor shared a [post](https://www.gobeyond.dev/packages-as-layers/) about organizing project structure. Inspired by it, I've devised a way to structure our project for greater modularity, avoiding cyclic imports and reducing the risk of collisions between variable names in the business logic. The proposed structure is as follows:

```shell
business_A.go
business_B.go
api/
--a.go
--b.go
business_a/
business_b/
```

In this structure, `business_A.go` and `business_B.go` house the types and interfaces for the business, while `business_a` and `business_b` contain implementations for those interfaces. These directories can store as many packages or files as needed. Note that:
- If `business_a` depends on `business_b`, the implementation in `business_a` should call `business_b` through the contract, which is essentially the interface defined in `business_B.go`.
- This approach reduces the likelihood of collisions between variable and function names in `business_a` and `business_b`.
